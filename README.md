# Python
Project in python with External API. 

 The app will offer a real time news feed and it will allow users the possibility to have access to the following events:
 
• Business news;

• Financial news;

• Sports news.

All the headline of news will be displayed in a Graphic User Interface and also the time it has being published.  The news will be available to the user and it is possible to save the information and check it later. Also, the users can manager their historic and delete and add information. The application will use an external API (https://newsapi.org/) to collect the news and show it to the users. The application has already set up to display only business, financial and sports news. 

# APPLICATION SET UP

To develop the application it was chosen to work with GUI (Graphical user interface). This choice was made because the interface helps the users when manipulating the application, that is, it is easier to access all the information within the application. Also, for better to visualize the execution of the registration and login system.

In Figure 1 you can see the access screen, which was designed to have the fewest buttons and be easy to access the registration and login system, it also features a welcome screen with the actual date and time information. give the user a feeling that they will get the latest and accurate time data.

Figure 1 First Screen - Log in and Register

Figure 2 shows the registration system that was developed to obtain only the password and username, this choice was made because the application did not intend to collect any information about the user, but only show the information, this also helps not cost of data storage.

Figures 3 and 4  show the login system, which was designed to be simple to access. this system was developed to help the user when he enters some wrong data, the system itself points out which data is, that is, wrong password or username. this is a good function as sometimes in the prey we enter wrong information while typing. This system also has the insertion of the password in the form of special characters "*" which gives security to the user when he is going to type the password near someone.

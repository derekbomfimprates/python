# Python
Project in python with External API. 

 The app will offer a real time news feed and it will allow users the possibility to have access to the following events:
 
• Business news;
• Financial news;
• Sports news.

All the headline of news will be displayed in a Graphic User Interface and also the time it has being
published. 

The news will be available to the user and it is possible to save the information and check it later.

Also, the users can manager their historic and delete and add information.

The application will use an external API (https://newsapi.org/) to collect the news and show it to the
users. The application has already set up to display only business, financial and sports news. 

APPLICATION SET UP

To develop the application it was chosen to work with GUI (Graphical user interface). This choice was made because the interface helps the users when manipulating the application, that is, it is easier to access all the information within the application. Also, for better to visualize the execution of the registration and login system.
In Figure 1 you can see the access screen, which was designed to have the fewest buttons and be easy to access the registration and login system, it also features a welcome screen with the actual date and time information. give the user a feeling that they will get the latest and accurate time data.
